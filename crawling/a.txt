Almost every woman in India has a story of sexual harassment that took place in crowded public spaces - when someone fondled her breasts or pinched her bottom, elbowed her
To hit back at their predators, women used whatever they had - for instance, as college students commuting in the overcrowded buses and trams in the eastern city of Kolkata decades ago, my friends and I used our umbrellas.
 in the chest or rubbed himself against her. Many of us also kept our nails long and sharp to scratch straying hands; others used the pointy heels of their stilettos to hit back at men who would take advantage of the crowd to press their penises into our backs.
Many others used a much more effective tool - the ubiquitous safety pin.
Since its invention in 1849, safety pins have been used by women around the world to hold different bits of clothing together, or to deal with a sudden wardrobe malfunction.
They have also been used by women globally to fight back against their harassers, even draw blood.
A few months back, several women in India took to Twitter to confess that they always carried a pin in their handbags or on their person, and that it was their weapon of choice to fight perverts in crowded spaces.
One of them - Deepika Shergill - wrote about an incident when she actually used it to draw blood. It happened on a bus she regularly took to commute to the office, Ms Shergill told the BBC. The incident took place decades ago, but she still remembered the tiniest details.
She was about 20 and her tormenter was in his mid-40s, he always wore a grey safari (a type of two-piece Indian suit popular with government workers) and open-toed sandals, and carried a rectangular leather bag.

"He would always come and stand next to me, lean over, rub his groin in my back, and fall over me each time the driver applied the brakes."

In those days, she says she was "very timid and didn't want to draw attention to myself", so she suffered in silence for months.

But one evening, when he "began masturbating and ejaculated on my shoulder", she decided it was enough.

"I felt defiled. On reaching home, I showered for a really long time. I didn't even tell my mother what had happened with me," she said.

"That night I couldn't sleep and even thought about quitting my job, but then I started thinking about revenge. I wanted to do bodily harm to him, to hurt him, to deter him from doing this to me ever again."

The next day, Ms Shergill swapped her flat shoes with stilettos and boarded the bus, armed with a safety pin.

"As soon as he came and stood next to me, I got up from my seat and crushed his toes with my heels. I heard him gasp, and felt a lot of joy. Then I used the pin to puncture his forearm and quickly exited the bus."

Although she continued to take that bus for another year, she said that was the last she saw of him.

Ms Shergill's story is shocking, but not rare.
